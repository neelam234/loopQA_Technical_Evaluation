**Playwright Test Suite for Asana Login and Web Application Tests**

This project is an evaluation test for a recruitment process. It utilizes Playwright and JavaScript to create a data-driven test suite for automating login and verifying tasks in a web application. The suite is designed to minimize code duplication and improve scalability by using a dynamic JSON-driven approach for the test cases.

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to create a Playwright-driven test suite that:

Automates login to a demo application.
Verifies task-related data in the web application through a set of predefined test cases.
Leverages a data-driven approach (from a JSON object) to minimize code duplication and improve maintainability as new test cases are added.
